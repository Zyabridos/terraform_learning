# Terraform Learning Journey
This repository documents my step-by-step progress in learning Terraform.
All lessons were **written manually** based on external materials â€” I used them as guidance only, not as a source for direct copy-paste.

## ðŸŽ“Credits

Special thanks to [Denis from ADV-IT](https://www.youtube.com/@ADV-IT) for his excellent Terraform tutorials.  
His clear explanations and structured approach played a big role in helping me understand key concepts and build confidence on my path toward becoming a DevOps Engineer.

## Skills covered

- Providers, resources, and variables
- Dynamic blocks and expressions
- Modules and workspaces
- Remote state & locking
- Provisioners & `user_data`
- LifeCycle rules (e.g. `create_before_destroy`)
- Auto Scaling Groups, Load Balancers
- Outputs and interpolations
- More are coming...

## This repo serves as:
- My personal study log
- A reference for common Terraform patterns
- A supplement to my real-world project (coming soon...)
